2. **Feature Inference Engine**
   ```javascript
   const inferUserCharacteristics = (age, occupation, location) => {
     return {
       incomeLevel: calculateIncome(occupation, location, age),
       educationLevel: inferEducation(occupation),
       housingSituation: inferHousing(age, income, location),

    qualityScores.richness + 
    qualityScores.emotion + 
    qualityScores.insight + 
    qualityScores.clarity
  ) / 4;
  
  // Quality multiplier
  let qualityMultiplier;
  if (overallQuality >= 4.5) qualityMultiplier = 1.0;
  else if (overallQuality >= 4.0) qualityMultiplier = 0.9;
  else if (overallQuality >= 3.5) qualityMultiplier = 0.8;
  else if (overallQuality >= 3.0) qualityMultiplier = 0.7;
  else qualityMultiplier = 0.6;
  
  // Tier multiplier
  const tierMultiplier = userTier === 'elite' ? 1.25 : 
                        userTier === 'pro' ? 1.15 : 1.0;
  
  // Demographic bonuses (Pro/Elite only)
  const demographicBonus = calculateDemographicBonus(userData, surveyRequirements);
